Unified Resource Initiative
---------------------------
The Unified Resource Initiative's goal is to unify all mods that add resources to the game.  Modders can use the resources in this mod to help unify the resources between other mods that also use the resources in this mod.  If you have a resource that you would like to add, just make a fork, add your resource, and then make a pull request. I haven't made any parts, so I am using ModuleManager and Firespitter to add resources to stock tanks.

TODO:

1. I still need to adjust the density for each resource.
2. The naturally occuring resources will be mapped out using the OpenResourceSystem mod.
3. A resource converter is planned.  The plugin needs to be built first.

Full release will be after the resource densities are adjusted.
