Unified Resource Initiative
---------------------------
The Unified Resource Initiative's goal is to unify all mods that add resources to the game.  Modders can use the resources in this mod to help unify the resources between other mods that also use the resources in this mod.  If you have a resource that you would like to add, just make a fork, add your resource, and then make a pull request.  

TODO:

1. I still need to adjust the density for each resource.
2. I haven't made any parts, so I am using ModuleManager and Firespitter to add resources to stock tanks.
